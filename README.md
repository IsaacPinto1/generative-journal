# Journal App

This is a simple journal application where users can write journal entries and receive wellness tips generated by the OpenAI API. The application consists of a front-end built with React and a back-end built with Node.js and Express. Data is stored in a MongoDB database.

## Features

- User authentication and login.
- Write and save journal entries for specific dates.
- Summarize journal entries and receive wellness tips using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- Resizable textarea for journal entries with a dynamically adjusting response container.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm: You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/). npm is included with Node.js.
- MongoDB: You can create a free MongoDB cluster and get a connection URI from [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
